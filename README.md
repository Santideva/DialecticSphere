# DialecticSphere

DialecticSphere is a vanilla JavaScript project that visualizes a dynamically deformable 3D sphere with an orbiting camera and interactive slider controls. Inspired by both geometric exploration and dialectical transformation, this project offers an engaging way to experiment with 3D deformations and camera movements directly in the browser.

## Features

- **Dynamic 3D Visualization:**  
  Render a deformable sphere whose shape is controlled by three distinct sine-wave modes.
- **Interactive Controls:**  
  Use sliders to adjust deformation amplitudes, camera rotation, and depth, and a toggle button to switch between manual and orbital camera modes.
- **Custom Camera Module:**  
  Incorporates a modular camera system with both manual control and an orbital path, enabling dynamic perspective changes.
- **Responsive Design:**  
  The canvas automatically resizes to fill the browser window, ensuring a seamless experience on different devices.
- **Simple Lighting Model:**  
  Includes basic lighting calculations to enhance the three-dimensional effect of the deformed sphere.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.) with HTML5 support.
- (Optional) A local server if you wish to test module imports (e.g., using [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) in VS Code).

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/DialecticSphere.git
   ```
